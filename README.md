# Hover Box (A JavaScript package)

A simple package to reveal some extra information on hover

> âš  **This package is still under development**
>
> Although it's in a usable state, there is still a little work to do - just to refine it
> - Primarily, there is CSS to add to the package, document changes and some more testing
>   - For now, you can implement the styling how you see fit and submit issues for any problems you find

## Usage

Add the below to your code to your project and you're away

```TS
const hB = new HoverBox(".HoverBox");

// Inside some other functions somewhere
hB.startListening();
hB.stopListening();
```
